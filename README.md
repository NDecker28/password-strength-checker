- Uppercase letter detection
- Numeric character detection
- Special character detection
- Strength classification (Weak, Medium, Strong)

## Purpose
The project was rewritten after debugging to ensure clean control flow and correct evaluation.
This project was built to practice core programming concepts including:
- Control flow (conditionals and loops)
- Functions and return values
- String traversal
- Debugging and logical reasoning

## How to run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Open a terminal in this directory
3. Run:
   python password_checker.py
